Using the diffrent functionalities of the software several research questions were answered. We have seen that sunshine and rain are as expected correlated with eachother were more rain means less sunshine. Additionaly we have seen that there is a definitive rising trend in the temperature data in germany from both the single plot and the plot of all weather parameters. We then used linear regression to fit this rise in temperature and predicted the temperature for the coming year which worked out to be 10 degrees celsius. We also saw that there are reoccuring patterns in the weather data via fourier-analysis."
