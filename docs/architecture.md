# Architecture

For our raindeer research software project we decided to employ the **Client-Server** Architecture.
It has several different characteristics, which makes it especially useful for our endeavor: 
- **multi-functionality:** embedding and usage with different technologies such as jupyter notebook, cli or python programms
- **independence:** Same data, same functionality independent of what interfaces you use
- **project maintenance:** simple setup results in high efficiency in maintaining the codebase

These make the **Client-Server** Architecture a robust and useful blueprint for our research project.
