# Functional Requirements:

Must:

As a researcher I want to be able to look at specific time periods in the data without much hassle

As a researcher, I want to receive results as a text (file) so that I can easily copy (import) it to other systems.

As a researcher, I want to generate a plot of temperature , percipitation, and sunshine over time so that I can see how they correlate.

Should:

As a researcher I want to be able to view patterns in the weather conditions such as reocurring events and their frequency

As an expert researcher, I want to be able to customize a lot so that the result fits my specific research question.

As a researcher from the US, I want to be able to get values in the United States customary system so that I intuitively know their significance.

As an expert climate researcher, I want to make a forecast of the temperature / percipitation / sunshine duration so that I know what the weather will be linke in the future.


Could:

As a vertical farming start up founder I want to reuse rain water and use solar energy to make the production even more resource efficient. To do that I need to know in what region I will get the most consistent rain through out the year.  Same applies for sunshine for solar energy and temperature . This all has to be put into a balance to figure out  the best place to built the farm.

As a researcher, I want to generate a plot of the German map with the average measures for different places so that I have a nice plot for my next presentation.

Won't:


# Non-Functional Requirements:

The system should run on Linus, MacOs and Windows.
The system should use Python 3.10. (Oder jede andere Version. Wir sollten uns nur auf eine festlegen.)
The system should have a command-line interface.
The project should come with a computational narrative. 
The system should respond in less than 2 seconds.
